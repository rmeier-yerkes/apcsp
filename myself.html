    <p>My name is Ryan Meier and I am 17 years old, a senior. I am most
    interested in the works of Tolkien and other Inklings, history (especially
    military history) and Jacobitism. My hobbies include writing code (just in
    Python for now, though I am learning Java), origami, poetry, and reading. My
    goals for this school year are to score at least a 5 (though I would settle
    with a 4) on all my AP tests, to score well at state in Academic Decathlon,
    and to be a strong leader on my Academic Decathlon team. My favorite
    television show is Forged in Fire and my favorite movie is <i>1917</i>. I
    don't listen to music much; my musical taste is probably best described as
    eclectic and antiquarian: I enjoy songs from a large variety of genres, but
    especially older-to-ancient music and Gregorian chant.</p>
